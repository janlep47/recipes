    Fish Patties

10 oz. thawed raw cod
10 oz. thawed raw shrimp
   2 tsp. thai red curry paste 
     ...OR (for Leland, since he doesn't like hot and spicy):
   1/2 tsp. paprika
   1/4 tsp. lemon grass powder
   1 clove garlic, sliced
   1 tsp. chopped fresh ginger
4 tsp. fresh lime juice
2 tsp. thai fish sauce
1/8 cup cornstarch
1 large egg
2 scallions, minced
1/3 cup chopped fresh cilantro
oil for frying

Puree everything in a food processor except the scallions, cilantro,
and oil.  Mix in the scallions and cilantro.  Heat the oil and pan fry
as patties.  (Original recipe says use a 4-oz scoop to measure out
pattie mixture, but I just winged it).  Sautee about 2 min on each
side.  (Directions also say to bake 10 min in a 375 degree oven after 
sauteeing, but I thought they were cooked enough in the pan - maybe my
patties were smaller).
